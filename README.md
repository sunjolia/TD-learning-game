# TD Learning Game

We created a Unity engine-based Tower Defense Game with the aim of being able to entertain and educate young kids who are 'Complex Care' patients,
as defined by Children's Health Hospital. Our hearts broke reading about the complicated processes involved with complex care patients, and we 
figured that not only are these kids probably bored, but they are also falling behind on school. Thus, we created an engaging tower defense
game with a UX of a mindless tapping forma. Kids will have to answer questions correctly in order to obtain cannons and defense towers to 
stop the enemies from reaching their base.

### Prerequisites & Installation

The game was built using Unity's game engine, and for now has not been built out into a deployable app. To view the game in play mode, 
either download Unity and open the file, or see the Giphy captures below.
