# TD Learning Game

We created a Unity engine-based Tower Defense Game with the aim of being able to entertain and educate young kids who are 'Complex Care' patients, as defined by Children's Health Hospital. Our hearts broke reading about the complicated processes involved with complex care patients, and we figured that not only are these kids probably bored while stuck in a hospital bed, but they are also falling behind on school. Thus, we created an engaging but easy to learn tower defense game. Kids will have to answer questions correctly in order to obtain cannons and defense towers to stop the enemies from reaching their home base.

### Prerequisites & Installation

The game was built using Unity's game engine, and for now has not been built out into a deployable app. To view the game in play mode, 
either download Unity and open the file, or see the Giphy captures below.

The blue spheres are enemies, which are spawned from their base tower in the bottom left of the screen. Every time an answer is answered 
correctly, the player has the option of placing either a defense tower or a defense cannon somewhere on the game map to help defend his/her
red base in the top right of the screen.
